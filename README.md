# 🎤 Speech-to-Text Machine Learning Pipeline

This repository provides a modular implementation of a **Speech-to-Text system** with integrated data exploration, feature extraction, model training, and inference capabilities. It is designed for researchers and developers working with speech data and machine learning models.

## 📁 Project Structure

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `librosa`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `joblib`
- `wave` (if using `.wav` files)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Data Exploration
Analyze distributions, durations, and other properties of audio/text data.

```bash
python data_exploration.py
```

### 2. Feature Extraction
Convert audio files to MFCCs or other feature representations.

```bash
python feature_extraction.py --input_dir ./data/audio --output_file features.csv
```

### 3. Model Training
Train a classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) on the extracted features.

```bash
python model_training.py --features_file features.csv --model_output model.pkl
```

### 4. Speech to Text Inference
Transcribe unseen audio files using the trained model.

```bash
python speech_to_text.py --model model.pkl --input ./data/test_audio.wav
```

## 📊 Sample Output

- Visualizations of audio features
- Accuracy, precision, recall of trained model
- Transcriptions of test files

## 🧠 Future Work

- Deep learning integration with CNN/RNN
- Real-time audio capture and transcription
- Speaker diarization and emotion detection
